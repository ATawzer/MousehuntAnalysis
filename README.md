# MousehuntAnalysis
Analyze runs from the online game Mousehunt. Provides wealth, point and special location analysis using useful statistical measures

# Storing the Data
In the runs folder are individual documents with the hunt information stored inside. The hunts are copy and pasted directly off the Mousehunt website and are stored by text documents organized by the user. To create a new run simply create a new text document, use the format in a pre-existing text document. The name of this file is how you will reference that run inside the program

# Main Menu Analysis
Right now there are three main ways to analyze your hunts: Run, Location and Cheese. The Main Menu allows you to analyze these three main components and breaks them down based on useful parameters described below. Before using any of these functions make sure to run the Create Data option, which populates the CSV file containing all of the hunt information.
