For usage:
1. Name file whatever you want, something intuitive for use in program. Place it in the Runs Folder
2. Copy and Paste journal entries off of internet. Start with the time on the first entry and copy through the end of the final entry
3. Make sure to fill out the information at the top of the run. If you change these parameters make a new run file
4. Run the Program! It'll do the rest

*note* as of version 1.0.0 you must delete progress reports from entries before running analysis!
